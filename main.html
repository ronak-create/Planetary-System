              <p>
                Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the
                Solar System. In English, it is named after the ancient Roman
                god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce and communication, and
                the messenger of the gods. Mercury is classified as a
                terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as
                Mars. The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, as a result of
                countless impact events that have accumulated over billions of
                years. Its largest crater, Caloris Planitia, has a diameter of
                1,550 km (960 mi) and one-third the diameter of the planet
                (4,880 km or 3,030 mi). Similarly to the Earth's Moon, Mercury's
                surface displays an expansive rupes system generated from thrust
                faults and bright ray systems formed by impact event remnants.

              <p>
                Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a terrestrial
                planet and is the closest in mass and size to its orbital
                neighbour Earth. Venus is notable for having the densest
                atmosphere of the terrestrial planets, composed mostly of carbon
                dioxide with a thick, global sulfuric acid cloud cover. At the
                surface it has a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F) and
                a pressure of 92 times that of Earth's at sea level. These
                extreme conditions compress carbon dioxide into a supercritical
                state close to Venus's surface.

                Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
                object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being a
                water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid
                surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its
                global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining
                29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the
                form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere.
                Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by
                vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts
                retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and
                atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly
                moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain
                ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer
                core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most
                of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.

                Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The surface of Mars is
                orange-red because it is covered in iron(III) oxide dust, giving

                of the Solar System's planets with a diameter of 6,779 km (4,212
                mi). In terms of orbital motion, a Martian solar day (sol) is
                equal to 24.5 hours and a Martian solar year is equal to 1.88
                Earth years (687 Earth days). Mars has two natural satellites

                Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the
                Solar System. A gas giant, Jupiter's mass is more than two and a
                half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System
                combined and slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of

                Gm) with an orbital period of 11.86 years. It is the third
                brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon
                and Venus and has been observed since prehistoric times. Its

                Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous
                cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the planet is made of water,
                ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which
                in astronomy is called 'ice' or volatiles. The planet's
                atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the
                lowest minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F) out of all
                the Solar System's planets. It has a marked axial tilt of 82.23°
                with a retrograde rotation period of 17 hours and 14 minutes.
                This means that in an 84-Earth-year orbital period around the
                Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight,
                followed by 42 years of continuous darkness.

                the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It
                is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than
                fellow ice giant Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically
                smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more
                gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Being composed
                primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid
                surface. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an
                orbital distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion
                kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god
                of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, representing
                Neptune's trident.
